# Advent of Code 2022

This years focus is coding in C and trying to get it running fast.

Run `aoc.sh run <day>` to compile and run day `<day>` against my personal input files in `input/`.

```
Day 1
	Part 1 solution: 694744 (51 µs)
	Part 2 solution: 2022586 (42 µs)

Day 2
	Part 1 solution: 13009 (51 µs)
	Part 2 solution: 10398 (41 µs)
Day 2 - optimized
	Buffering input file: 10000 bytes in 39 µs
	Part 1 solution: 13009 (5 µs)
	Part 2 solution: 10398 (12 µs)
```
